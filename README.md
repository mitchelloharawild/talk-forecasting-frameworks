#### Abstract

A well designed interface is instrumental in making software easy to
learn and use. The design of statistical software is inherently
subjective, and there are many difficult decisions involved in creating
interfaces that work cohesively within the intended domain. A
forecasting framework sets out the design language for the forecasting
workflow, guiding users conceptually about how different steps relate to
one another. Making each element of the workflow extensible enables
developers to implement new models, accuracy metrics, or other
forecasting techniques that can be immediately used in conjunction with
other forecasting elements. In this talk, I will examine the design
decisions made when creating fable, the tidy time series forecasting
successor of the forecast package.
